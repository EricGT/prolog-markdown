# prolog-markdown

Markdown parser implemented in Prolog. Compatible with [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) as the
output tree is for direct use by [print_html/2](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=print_html/2).

The "specification" for the parser was taken from <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>.
